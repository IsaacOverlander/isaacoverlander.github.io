        <h2>Software Engineer</h2>
           <p>I have been around computers, and programing for most of my life.  
I originally became interested in programing because of video games. 
Having tinkered with them since I got my first computer, I eventually 
looked into what it takes to create them, and learned that having a 
working knowledge of Object Oriented Programming would help to 
think in ways that would make video game development easier to learn. 
I picked up a couple books on programing (Code Complete, C# and 
the .NET Framework, Working Effectively with Legacy Code, etc.) and
reading through the books furthered my interest for the profession. 
In august of 2016 I had the opportunity to attend a CobbleIT session, 
where I worked with a team to create the basis for a dynamic online 
cataloging system for Red Wing Shoes and in February of 2017 I 
returned for another session to  develop with the Amazon Alexa SkillKit . 
I have taken and completed Mulesoft Developer courses and recieved 
my MCD (Mulesoft Certified Developer) Certificate</p>
